 ### Challenges encountered while building app
 1. After running the app several times android studio would notfiy me that "Waiting for taregeted device to come online" and anytime this would happen the emulator would not work.
 I solved this challenge through:
(a) Running the app on my phone - Had to learn how to set phone on developer mode and configure it to android studio
(b) Everytime I would wipe data from the emulator the above error would be rectified.
